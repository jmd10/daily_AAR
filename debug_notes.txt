Currently I cannot click on register or login without getting a bad page.

If I go into the url line and type in 'users/login/' or 'users/register/' then
everything looks good. However, clicking on the link makes things go bad.

- The code appears right in 'base.html', 'register.html', and 'login.html'. It
is seeming that the problem is in the redirection when the link is clicked.

How does it route??
  - click on the link


I tried to put in a "url_patterns" path in 'AARs/urls' (path('register/', viewand 
that shut down the whole site
