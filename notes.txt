Things to improve prior to release...

Before release to the impact theory group. Can I:

A) make the journal topic permanent for all users.

  - I think to do this, I need to create a permanent page, that mimics the
      type of page that would be created for any user created page.
  - There is a link for it on the "topics" page to be in alignment with users
      created pages.
  - when it opens, it opens to its own page like, 'topics/journal' instead of
      'topics/topic_id'.

  .... How do I do this???

        - I need to go through the same process as with any other page. URL, views,
            html page...

        - BEFORE I DO THIS... I need to make sure all have a way of retreating... that is
            either by tracking the changes, so I can delete what I've done, or
            by using github or heroku (I think git hub, then push when working to
            Heroku). This is preferred, as this is something I need to know how
            to do.
