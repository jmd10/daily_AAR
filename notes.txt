Things to improve prior to release...

Before release to the impact theory group. Can I:

A) make the journal topic permanent for all users.

B) make what is shown shorter (say 200 character s) and change edit to "read / edit "
    - In 'topic' in the view.py file, added (max_length=50) to 'action'
        - fail
    - I think it needs to be done in topic.html. I think there needs to an html
      command to tell it to only display 50 or 100 or 200 characters...
