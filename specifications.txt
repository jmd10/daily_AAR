AAR Specification
AAR (‘After Action Report’) is designed to be an app that:
1.	 will allow for the journaling of actions, reflection on the outcomes, and identification
  of ways to reinforce what went well, improve what could have been done better, and ways to avoid,
  or minimize the risk, of that which went poorly.

2.	Provide space for the planning of what was identified in part 1 so it is not merely a
  journaling exercise but instead provides an environment to design, plan, and schedule
  the implementation of the improvements and solutions identified in part 1.

I want this to be part of the same section. The separation of the past action and the
future changes or reinforcements or what needs to be done seems to create a loss of
immediacy or a decrease in association. I think that there should be a reflection on
three things with the identification of one of those to reinforce (good), improve
(could have been better), or prevent (failure). So, Ideally, the question is, for
example, “what are three things you did well today?”. Each of these is identified and
made into a separate entry (though in the beginning it’ll likely have to be a daily log),
then, on the same page but lower is another content/text box asking “what is one
thing you can put in place or do to reinforce what you did well (or some other wording)?”…
and finally another box saying, “what is one thing you will do or put in place to increase
the likelihood of the above happening?”

	1.  Reflection
	2.  Identification of area for gains/improvement
	3.  Development of action to manifest the gain/improvement

This is not intended for business or government (where AARs are frequently used after projects
or operations) but instead is intended for daily use by people to review their day, find ways
to continually improve, and to implement those improvements.
